      <p><b>Magadheera</b></p>
      <p><b>Discription:</b>In 1609, the kingdom of Udaigarh, ruled by King Vikram Singh, faces an impending invasion by Emperor Sher Khan. The kingdom’s bravest warrior, Kaala Bhairava (Harsha), is secretly in love with Vikram Singh’s daughter, Yuvarani Mithravindha Devi (Indu), who reciprocates his feelings. However, Bhairava refrains from expressing his love. Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), son of Vikram Singh's late sister and the royal general, desires to marry Mithra. He arranges a duel with Bhairava, declaring that the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished. Bhairava wins, leading to Ranadev's exile. Vikram Singh later persuades Bhairava to reject Mithra’s love, fearing that he will die in battle, leaving her widowed. Bhairava, though heartbroken, complies.
      Bhairava takes Mithra, his soldiers, and caretakers to Bhairavakona Temple atop a cliff to seek Lord Shiva's blessings before battle. Mithra urges Bhairava to confess his love, but when he remains silent, she disrupts the puja and paints his image with her blood. An injured soldier arrives with news that Ranadev has allied with Khan’s army, and has killed Vikram Singh and is advancing toward them. Khan challenges Bhairava to kill 100 of his soldiers. Bhairava succeeds but is severely wounded. Impressed by his bravery, Khan has a change of heart and befriends him. However, Ranadev insists on continuing the battle and fatally stabs Mithra before Bhairava beheads him. As Mithra dies, she asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can, she falls off the cliff. Devastated, Bhairava jumps after her, embracing the same fate.</p>

      <p><b>Orange</b></p>
      <p><b>Discription:</b>Ram is a youngster who does graffiti and does not believe in everlasting love. He has gone through nine loves in his life and thinks that love between two people eventually dies out. As a person with strong morals, he is honest and wants to love life and live with an open mind, open thought, and open action with his lover. Jaanu studies in the same college as Ram. He falls in love with her at first sight and goes on wooing her. She eventually ends up falling for him but wants him to promise to love her forever. Ram, of course, nonchalantly dismisses this and explains how he cannot love her forever. This leads to a clash of their ideologies. Ram shows Jaanu how true love cannot stay forever, while Jaanu shows him examples of everlasting love, like her friends and her parents. However, he makes it clear that love between two people is never the same as it first is.
Abishek makes Ram tell him why he feels like this, and Ram explains another love in his life: Rooba. He falls in love with her as she visits Hyderabad when he is on a foreign exchange project. He follows her to Mumbai, and they both fall in love. However, as time passes, the couple faces problems, and Ram feels himself lying more and more just to make Rooba happy. Unable to take it anymore, he tells her that he cannot continue loving her if he has to lie and sacrifice so much for her. They break up, and through the experience, Ram becomes the man he is. Ram tries wooing Jaanu once again but soon backs off knowing her desire for a commitment and a life partner. In the end, the story again focuses on the present where Ram is shown defacing Jaanu's face in his graffiti. Abishek also realizes that Ram is right in his own way. Ram reveals that Jaanu asked him to give up graffiti and get into a job as a painting teacher. Initially, Ram is reluctant but realizes that he loves himself more than he loves his partner so he should start loving his partner more and even learns that sacrifices are an integral part of a relationship. Hence he sacrifices graffiti and decides to propose to Jaanu again, trying to be committed this time. Ram and Jaanu end up together when the credits are rolling.</p>

Ballem Balaram is an aspiring politician, who tries to bribe Bhuvan as the former had seized his black money. However, Bhuvan refuses, which infruriates Balaram and threatens him, but Ram threatens him back in front of the media.

Following a party where Ram and Bheem out-dance the pompous English attendees, Jenny invites Bheem to her residence, where he finds Malli and promises to free her soon after. Meanwhile, Ram locates Lachhu and apprehends him. While being interrogated, Lachhu sets a banded krait onto Ram and warns him of his imminent death and that the antidote is only known to the Gonds. Bheem finds Ram, saves his life, and divulges his tribal identity and mission, unaware of Ram's true identity. That night, at an event to honour Governor Buxton, Bheem's men barge into his residence with a truck filled with wild animals; they maul Buxton's guards, creating havoc among the guests. Ram arrives and fights Bheem; Bheem is forced to stand down when Buxton holds Malli at gunpoint. Bheem is arrested and Ram is promoted.
A flashback reveals that Ram's father Alluri Venkatarama Raju was a revolutionary who hoped to arm his village with British rifles but was killed by British soldiers before he got the chance. Ram subsequently left his village and his fiancée Sita to become a mole within the police, his promotion for having captured Bheem finally giving him access to the gun shipments. At Bheem's public flogging, Ram attempts to persuade him to recant his actions; Bheem chooses flogging instead. Bheem sings in defiance of his injuries, inciting the assembled crowd into rebellion, and further enlightening Ram. He persuades Buxton to execute Bheem in secrecy in front of Malli while preparing an ambush to rescue both of them, but Buxton deduces the plan, and Ram is injured while rescuing Malli. Bheem, thinking Malli is in danger, bludgeons Ram and escapes with the girl. Ram is arrested for treason and imprisoned in solitary confinement</p>
